Rough notes:

so i have a bunch of issues with my watching habits that I want to solve with a similar app.

a) I want to be notified if a show I've watched has a new season. major apps (netflix) kinda do that but there's no visibility.
b) I watch multiple things at a time. I want to sometimes pick things based on mood, for just an hour etc.
c) I want to discover movies based on the cast of a movie that I have watched etc.
d) and a bunch of other stuff
plus a bunch of LLM-related features.

social features are not my priority but they can be added later anyways.

I also want active focus on sharing notes about a movie with the app (social feed for sharing with friends can come later). things like "<scene>: omg, this was so well written that I'm sweating in an air-conditioned room"

like how you frantically chat with a friend after you're done watching a movie or a series.

I am not much focused on comprehensive movie data right now. I am at a hackathon, so everyone know that getting movie data is possible. My goal to share my vision of enabling a better entertainment experience for the modern human where watching content (movies and shows) is a major part of our lives (that we used to do rarely 10 years ago).
